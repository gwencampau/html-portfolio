<h1>Best Movies According to Gwen</h1>
<h2>My Current Top 3</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Incredibles</h3>
<p>This movie was such a big part of my childhood. I loved it then and still love it now. It's just the right amount of drama and comedy.</p>
<h3>Austenland</h3>
<p>My favorite spin-off of Pride and Prejudice. It's very funny and made by the same people as Napoleon Dynamite.</p>
<h3>Secondhand Lions</h3>
<p>Heart-warming story-within-a-story type of movie. Contains many shenanigans involving grumpy old men and a lion.</p>
